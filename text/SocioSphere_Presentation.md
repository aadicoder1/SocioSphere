## "Connecting Communities, Empowering Change."

## What's the Aim?

The goal of SocioSphere is simple – to make it easier for people to report local social issues and for NGOs to take meaningful action.  
We want to bridge the communication gap and make communities stronger and more responsive.

## What Can You Do on SocioSphere?

- Create accounts as a User or NGO  
- Report issues with images and exact locations  
- NGOs can view, respond, and manage these reports  
- Admin can monitor activities and ensure transparency  
- NGOs can post events like drives, camps, and fairs  
- Clean, easy interface with pagination for long lists

## How It Works

1. Sign up as a User or NGO  
2. Log in to access your dashboard  
3. Users submit reports with details and location  
4. NGOs can respond, resolve, or follow up on reports  
5. Admin oversees everything to keep it running smooth
