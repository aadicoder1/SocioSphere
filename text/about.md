## 🧩 Overview

**SocioSphere** is a community-driven web platform that enables citizens to report social and environmental issues—such as garbage dumping, injured stray animals, or unsafe public infrastructure—and connects them directly with local NGOs or civic bodies that can act on them.

It bridges the gap between concerned individuals and action-takers by making social good accessible, traceable, and impactful.
